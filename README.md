# ANN-for-BANKS
This is an fully connected 2 layers  ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) made using tensorflow,pandas and numpy.

As we know that many citizens of every country leave the bank or otherwise gets shifted to other banks.As banks have millions of users and it is impossible for human to sit and analyze whether the new person in the bank will stay or leave the bank.But this ANN can easily predict whether the person will leave the bank or not which help the bank a lot.

SGD(Stochastic Gradient Descent) is used in this ANN as this  method helps in increasing accuracy.

NOTES(used functions):
1)optimizer  : ADAM
2)activation functions: RELU,SIGMOID
3)loss = binary_crossentropy
4)no of epochs=100

DATASET is provided with the name (Churn_Modelling.csv) .This dataset is downloaded from kaggle.

You can also predict any of your test case by just opening the code in google collab provided above.
